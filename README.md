# ansible_logrotate
This project is subtly different from [rotate-user-logs](https://github.com/athajaerel/rotate-user-logs): that one is intended to run daily and this is intended to run immediately after an ansible playbook.

I'm having trouble figuring out how to run it after the final log entry.
